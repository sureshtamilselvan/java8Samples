New date-time API is introduced in Java 8 to overcome the following drawbacks of old date-time API : 

Not thread safe : Unlike old java.util.Date which is not thread safe the new date-time API is immutable and doesnâ€™t have setter methods.
Less operations : In old API there are only few date operations but the new API provides us with many date operations.
Java 8 under the package java.time introduced a new date-time API, most important classes among them are :  

Local : Simplified date-time API with no complexity of timezone handling.
Zoned : Specialized date-time API to deal with various timezones.
LocalDate/LocalTime and LocalDateTime API : Use it when time zones are NOT required.
